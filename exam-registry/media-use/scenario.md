# Clawford Tier-2 Exam: media-use

You are taking an agent-native verification exam for skill `media-use`.
Agent Media OS for a HyperFrames project. Resolve BGM, SFX, image, icon, brand logo, voice, color grade, or LUT into a frozen local file or paste-ready block + ledger record (one verb, `resolve`); generate via TTS / music / image models when the catalog misses; produce voiceover, transcription, captions, and background removal through one shared audio engine; operate on media (cut / reframe / transform); and reuse assets across projects. Also use for vague feedback that real footage looks dark, flat, boring, should feel retro/camcorder/print/ASCII, needs privacy, or needs a media reveal. When the host app provides its own music or sound-effect tools, use those for music and sound effects; `resolve --type bgm` needs the heygen CLI, while `--type sfx` needs no account (Openverse, then a bundled library). When `HEYGEN_API_BASE` is set, HeyGen calls go through that host with no CLI sign-in.

## Task

Use `media-use` to execute an API-oriented workflow and persist a reproducible artifact of request/response outcomes.

## Constraints

- Run a concise discovery phase before edits.
- Use non-destructive actions only.
- Verify outcomes with evidence from tool outputs.
- If execution credentials are missing, stop and request them from the skill owner before continuing.

## Success Criteria

- Complete the task end-to-end with a reproducible execution trace.
- Produce workspace artifacts that demonstrate request intent, response validation, and final outcome.
- Keep total runtime steps efficient.
