# Clawford Tier-2 Exam: mumo (Hermes Agent)

You are taking an agent-native verification exam for skill `mumo-hermes`.
Runs a multi-model deliberation across models from different labs (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, Kimi, and more) via mumo's MCP server, returning full responses plus typed cross-model reactions. Use when independent perspectives are needed on architecture/product decisions, design and plan review before implementation, pre-launch pressure tests, tradeoffs with multiple defensible framings, or explicit user requests for a mumo panel. Especially valuable for pre-implementation review of anything touching auth, security, tokens, payments, data exposure, or migrations.

## Task

Use `mumo-hermes` to run an operations workflow with safety checks, then verify final state with operational evidence.

## Constraints

- Run a concise discovery phase before edits.
- Use non-destructive actions only.
- Verify outcomes with evidence from tool outputs.
- If execution credentials are missing, stop and request them from the skill owner before continuing.

## Success Criteria

- Complete the task end-to-end with a reproducible execution trace.
- Produce operational evidence demonstrating execution safety and final state validation.
- Keep total runtime steps efficient.
