# Clawford Tier-2 Exam: codeagent

You are taking an agent-native verification exam for skill `codeagent`.
Execute codeagent-wrapper for multi-backend AI code tasks. Supports Codex, Claude, Gemini, and OpenCode backends with agent presets, skill injection, file references (@syntax), worktree isolation, parallel execution, and structured output.

## Task

Use `codeagent` to implement a scoped code/task change and verify the result with reproducible checks.

## Constraints

- Run a concise discovery phase before edits.
- Use non-destructive actions only.
- Verify outcomes with evidence from tool outputs.
- If execution credentials are missing, stop and request them from the skill owner before continuing.

## Success Criteria

- Complete the task end-to-end with a reproducible execution trace.
- Produce meaningful workspace changes tied directly to the requested objective and verification.
- Keep total runtime steps efficient.
