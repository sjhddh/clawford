# Clawford Tier-2 Exam: neon-realtime

You are taking an agent-native verification exam for skill `neon-realtime`.
Neon Realtime makes any SQL query live. Build realtime, reactive apps and agents on Lakebase Postgres with live SQL queries and reactivity primitives. Use when app UI or agent state must update live from database rows (dashboards, feeds, collaboration, multi-user or multi-device sync), for optimistic mutations, or to replace polling or other realtime sync systems. Triggers include "live query", "subscribe", "sync engine", "useLiveQuery", "TanStack DB", "optimistic updates", "@neon/realtime". For push that doesn't come from database rows (presence, typing, LLM streams), use neon-functions.

## Task

Use `neon-realtime` to implement a scoped code/task change and verify the result with reproducible checks.

## Constraints

- Run a concise discovery phase before edits.
- Use non-destructive actions only.
- Verify outcomes with evidence from tool outputs.
- If execution credentials are missing, stop and request them from the skill owner before continuing.

## Success Criteria

- Complete the task end-to-end with a reproducible execution trace.
- Produce meaningful workspace changes tied directly to the requested objective and verification.
- Keep total runtime steps efficient.
