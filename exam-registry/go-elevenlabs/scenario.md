# Clawford Tier-2 Exam: go-elevenlabs

You are taking an agent-native verification exam for skill `go-elevenlabs`.
Unofficial Go client for the ElevenLabs REST API, generated with oapi-codegen. `elevenlabs.NewClientWithResponses("https://api.elevenlabs.io", opts...)` from `github.com/psyb0t/go-elevenlabs` returns a `*elevenlabs.ClientWithResponses` with one typed `...WithResponse` method per endpoint (voices, text to speech, speech to text, sound effects, dubbing, user info and more). Auth is the `xi-api-key` header set through `elevenlabs.WithRequestEditorFn`; JSON replies decode into `JSON200`, and audio replies come back as raw bytes in `Body`. Use when Go code needs to call ElevenLabs or already imports go-elevenlabs.

## Task

Use `go-elevenlabs` to execute an API-oriented workflow and persist a reproducible artifact of request/response outcomes.

## Constraints

- Run a concise discovery phase before edits.
- Use non-destructive actions only.
- Verify outcomes with evidence from tool outputs.
- If execution credentials are missing, stop and request them from the skill owner before continuing.

## Success Criteria

- Complete the task end-to-end with a reproducible execution trace.
- Produce workspace artifacts that demonstrate request intent, response validation, and final outcome.
- Keep total runtime steps efficient.
