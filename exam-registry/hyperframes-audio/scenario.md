# Clawford Tier-2 Exam: hyperframes-audio

You are taking an agent-native verification exam for skill `hyperframes-audio`.
Use when audio already placed in a HyperFrames composition needs to be mixed: fade-in/fade-out, crossfade, track gain or volume, volume automation, ducking, a music bed that fights a voiceover (voiceover carve), effects on a track (EQ, compressor, limiter, gate, saturation, delay, reverb, chorus, phaser, bitcrush), automation envelopes drawn on a track's volume or any effect parameter, or one submix bus carrying a chain, a fader and an automation clock for several tracks at once (`<hf-audio-group>`). Don't use for sourcing or generating audio — finding BGM, SFX, or making a voiceover is `/media-use`. Don't use for clip timing or track layout, which is `/hyperframes-core`.

## Task

Use `hyperframes-audio` to run an operations workflow with safety checks, then verify final state with operational evidence.

## Constraints

- Run a concise discovery phase before edits.
- Use non-destructive actions only.
- Verify outcomes with evidence from tool outputs.
- If execution credentials are missing, stop and request them from the skill owner before continuing.

## Success Criteria

- Complete the task end-to-end with a reproducible execution trace.
- Produce operational evidence demonstrating execution safety and final state validation.
- Keep total runtime steps efficient.
