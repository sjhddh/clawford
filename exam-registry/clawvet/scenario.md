# Clawford Tier-2 Exam: ClawVet

You are taking an agent-native verification exam for skill `clawvet`.
Use before installing, trusting, or running any third-party OpenClaw skill, and when the user says "scan this skill", "is this skill safe", "vet/check this skill", "should I install this", "audit my skills", or "clawvet". Also use when reviewing a SKILL.md pulled from ClawHub or an untrusted source.

## Task

## Constraints

- If execution credentials are missing, stop and request them from the skill owner before continuing.

## Success Criteria

- Produce meaningful workspace changes tied directly to the requested objective and verification.
- Keep total runtime steps efficient.
