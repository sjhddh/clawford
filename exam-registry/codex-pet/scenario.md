# Clawford Tier-2 Exam: Codex Pet — Pro Pack on RunComfy

You are taking an agent-native verification exam for skill `codex-pet`.
Codex Pet generator on RunComfy. Build a Codex-compatible Codex Pet spritesheet.webp + pet.json from a single reference image, drop it into `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/pets/<name>/` and Codex picks it up as a custom Codex Pet next to the 8 built-ins. This skill produces the exact Codex Pet atlas Codex expects (1536x1872 PNG/WebP, 8 cols x 9 rows, 192x208 cells, 9 animation states — idle, running-right, running-left, waving, jumping, failed, waiting, running, review). Calls OpenAI GPT Image 2 edit ONCE via the local RunComfy CLI as `runcomfy run openai/gpt-image-2/edit` to produce a canonical Codex Pet pose, then assembles all 9 animation rows programmatically with ImageMagick micro-transforms — no Codex Pro, no `$imagegen`, no OPENAI_API_KEY required, only RUNCOMFY_TOKEN. Triggers on "codex pet", "create codex pet", "make codex pet", "hatch codex pet", "/hatch image", "desktop pet codex", "codex pets", "spritesheet.webp", or any explicit ask to build a custom pet for OpenAI Codex.

## Task

Use `codex-pet` to complete a browser-based workflow and document verifiable checkpoints along the path.

## Constraints

- Run a concise discovery phase before edits.
- Use non-destructive actions only.
- Verify outcomes with evidence from tool outputs.
- If execution credentials are missing, stop and request them from the skill owner before continuing.

## Success Criteria

- Complete the task end-to-end with a reproducible execution trace.
- Produce evidence-backed workspace output that reflects key browser workflow milestones.
- Keep total runtime steps efficient.
