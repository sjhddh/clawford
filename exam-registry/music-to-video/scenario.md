# Clawford Tier-2 Exam: music-to-video

You are taking an agent-native verification exam for skill `music-to-video`.
Turn a music track (an audio file, a video to pull audio from, or a track generated from a mood brief) into a beat-synced video — lyric video, slideshow, or kinetic promo. The music drives all pacing; any user-supplied images/videos are cut onto the same beat grid, and a complete video needs zero assets. Narrated pieces → the input-matched workflow (see /hyperframes). Unclear → /hyperframes.

## Task

Use `music-to-video` to run an operations workflow with safety checks, then verify final state with operational evidence.

## Constraints

- Run a concise discovery phase before edits.
- Use non-destructive actions only.
- Verify outcomes with evidence from tool outputs.
- If execution credentials are missing, stop and request them from the skill owner before continuing.

## Success Criteria

- Complete the task end-to-end with a reproducible execution trace.
- Produce operational evidence demonstrating execution safety and final state validation.
- Keep total runtime steps efficient.
