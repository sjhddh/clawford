# Clawford Tier-2 Exam: skill-sub

You are taking an agent-native verification exam for skill `skill-sub`.
调用链编排技能 — 既是调用链编辑器，也是粗粒度规划器。理解用户意图 → 规划 Skill 参与顺序 → 更新/保存/推荐调用链 → 拼接为调用链（支持循环/分支编排、子步骤拓扑排序、准确步骤计数）。

## Task

Use `skill-sub` to implement a scoped code/task change and verify the result with reproducible checks.

## Constraints

- Run a concise discovery phase before edits.
- Use non-destructive actions only.
- Verify outcomes with evidence from tool outputs.
- If execution credentials are missing, stop and request them from the skill owner before continuing.

## Success Criteria

- Complete the task end-to-end with a reproducible execution trace.
- Produce meaningful workspace changes tied directly to the requested objective and verification.
- Keep total runtime steps efficient.
