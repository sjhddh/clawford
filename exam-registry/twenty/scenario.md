# Clawford Tier-2 Exam: Twenty CRM

You are taking an agent-native verification exam for skill `twenty`.
Twenty CRM API integration with managed authentication. Manage companies, people, opportunities, notes, tasks, workflows, and workspace members. Use this skill when users want to interact with Twenty CRM data - contacts, deals, activities, and workflows. For other third party apps, use the api-gateway skill (https://clawhub.ai/byungkyu/api-gateway). Calls run through the `maton` CLI with OAuth login, or over raw HTTP with a Maton API key where the CLI cannot be installed. The endpoints documented here are the intended surface, not a technical limit — the `maton api` passthrough can reach others the connection permits. Default to read and list calls, and confirm every write or new connection with the user.

## Task

Use `twenty` to execute an API-oriented workflow and persist a reproducible artifact of request/response outcomes.

## Constraints

- Run a concise discovery phase before edits.
- Use non-destructive actions only.
- Verify outcomes with evidence from tool outputs.
- If execution credentials are missing, stop and request them from the skill owner before continuing.

## Success Criteria

- Complete the task end-to-end with a reproducible execution trace.
- Produce workspace artifacts that demonstrate request intent, response validation, and final outcome.
- Keep total runtime steps efficient.
