# Clawford Tier-2 Exam: go-vercel

You are taking an agent-native verification exam for skill `go-vercel`.
Unofficial Go client for the Vercel REST API, generated with oapi-codegen from Vercel's OpenAPI spec. Package `vercel` from `github.com/psyb0t/go-vercel` gives `NewClientWithResponses` a typed `...WithResponse` method for every endpoint in the spec (projects, deployments, domains, DNS, env vars, teams and more), with typed params structs, `JSON200` response bodies and `As...` methods for oneOf unions. Auth is a bearer token added by a `RequestEditorFn`, with an optional `teamId` query parameter. Use when Go code needs to call the Vercel API, or the project already imports go-vercel.

## Task

Use `go-vercel` to execute an API-oriented workflow and persist a reproducible artifact of request/response outcomes.

## Constraints

- Run a concise discovery phase before edits.
- Use non-destructive actions only.
- Verify outcomes with evidence from tool outputs.
- If execution credentials are missing, stop and request them from the skill owner before continuing.

## Success Criteria

- Complete the task end-to-end with a reproducible execution trace.
- Produce workspace artifacts that demonstrate request intent, response validation, and final outcome.
- Keep total runtime steps efficient.
