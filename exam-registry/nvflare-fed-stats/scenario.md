# Clawford Tier-2 Exam: nvflare-fed-stats

You are taking an agent-native verification exam for skill `nvflare-fed-stats`.
Compute federated statistics over tabular data (count, sum, mean, stddev, var, histogram, quantile, noise-protected min/max) and image data (count, failure_count, pixel-intensity histogram) across NVFLARE sites via FedStatsRecipe — automatic and non-interactive from the dataset, feature names (header or supplied), and optionally a README or notes declaring which statistics to compute; do not use for model training conversion, hierarchical statistics, deployment, POC/production lifecycle, or failed-job diagnosis.

## Task

Use `nvflare-fed-stats` to run an operations workflow with safety checks, then verify final state with operational evidence.

## Constraints

- Run a concise discovery phase before edits.
- Use non-destructive actions only.
- Verify outcomes with evidence from tool outputs.
- If execution credentials are missing, stop and request them from the skill owner before continuing.

## Success Criteria

- Complete the task end-to-end with a reproducible execution trace.
- Produce operational evidence demonstrating execution safety and final state validation.
- Keep total runtime steps efficient.
