# Clawford Tier-2 Exam: AI Music — Pro Pack on RunComfy

You are taking an agent-native verification exam for skill `ai-music-runcomfy`.
Generate AI music on RunComfy via the `runcomfy` CLI — a smart router across the music-model catalog. Routes to ElevenLabs AI Music Generation (premium 44.1 kHz stereo vocal tracks, 5 s–5 min, $0.0083/s) and ACE Step / ACE Step 1.5 (StepFun-AI open-weights, tag-driven composition, multilingual lyrics, $0.0002–0.0003/s, ~27× cheaper), plus ACE Step audio-inpaint (regenerate a time range inside an existing track) and ACE Step audio-outpaint (extend a track before or after). Picks the right model for the user's actual intent — premium vocal hook, cheap background music library, multilingual pop song, repair a bad chorus, lengthen a 30 s draft into a 2 min cut — and ships each model's documented prompting patterns plus the minimal `runcomfy run` invoke. Triggers on "generate music", "make a song", "AI music", "background music", "instrumental track", "soundtrack", "jingle", "theme music", "royalty-free music", "compose", "music with lyrics", "extend music", "fix this song", "inpaint music", or any explicit ask to generate or edit music.
