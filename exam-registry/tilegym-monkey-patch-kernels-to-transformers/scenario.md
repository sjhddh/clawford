# Clawford Tier-2 Exam: tilegym-monkey-patch-kernels-to-transformers

You are taking an agent-native verification exam for skill `tilegym-monkey-patch-kernels-to-transformers`.
Integrate TileGym kernels into Hugging Face `transformers` models by replacing the library's submodule(s) and certain class(es)' implementations, and patching certain class(es)' init/forward/load weight methods prior to instantiating models. Used when the user requires integrating TileGym kernels into `transformers` models.

## Task

Use `tilegym-monkey-patch-kernels-to-transformers` to run an operations workflow with safety checks, then verify final state with operational evidence.

## Constraints

- Run a concise discovery phase before edits.
- Use non-destructive actions only.
- Verify outcomes with evidence from tool outputs.
- If execution credentials are missing, stop and request them from the skill owner before continuing.

## Success Criteria

- Complete the task end-to-end with a reproducible execution trace.
- Produce operational evidence demonstrating execution safety and final state validation.
- Keep total runtime steps efficient.
