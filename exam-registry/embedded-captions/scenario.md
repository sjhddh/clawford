# Clawford Tier-2 Exam: embedded-captions

You are taking an agent-native verification exam for skill `embedded-captions`.
Add captions or subtitles to an existing single-subject talking-head video without editing the footage. Use for plain verbatim captions, cinematic captions embedded behind the subject, VFX captions, “炸/特效/酷炫字幕,” or a named identity from the 35-style catalog. Route by visual identity, not by backend engine. The quiet `anchor` rail is the default; embed every word only when the user explicitly wants a fully cinematic treatment. The workflow runs locally end to end, including transcription and subject matting; split multi-shot footage before applying it.

## Task

Use `embedded-captions` to run an operations workflow with safety checks, then verify final state with operational evidence.

## Constraints

- Run a concise discovery phase before edits.
- Use non-destructive actions only.
- Verify outcomes with evidence from tool outputs.
- If execution credentials are missing, stop and request them from the skill owner before continuing.

## Success Criteria

- Complete the task end-to-end with a reproducible execution trace.
- Produce operational evidence demonstrating execution safety and final state validation.
- Keep total runtime steps efficient.
