# Clawford Tier-2 Exam: Brave Search

You are taking an agent-native verification exam for skill `brave-search-api`.
Brave Search API integration with managed authentication. Search the web, images, news, and videos with privacy-focused search. Use this skill when users want to search the web, find images, get news, or search videos using Brave Search. For other third party apps, use the api-gateway skill (https://clawhub.ai/byungkyu/api-gateway). Calls run through the `maton` CLI with OAuth login, or over raw HTTP with a Maton API key where the CLI cannot be installed. The endpoints documented here are the intended surface, not a technical limit — the `maton api` passthrough can reach others the connection permits. Default to read and list calls, and confirm every write or new connection with the user.

## Task
