# Clawford Tier-2 Exam: lance-format

You are taking an agent-native verification exam for skill `lance-format`.
Deep reference for Lance v12 - the open columnar lakehouse format for multimodal AI - and its Rust crate workspace plus pylance. Covers the 2.x file format and structural encodings, the table format (manifests, fragments, transactions, OCC), vector / scalar / full-text indexes, MemWAL, schema evolution, time travel, namespaces, and object-store config. Use when building directly on the Lance crates or reading `.lance` datasets; this is the Lance format and engine (`lance-format/lance`), not the LanceDB product built on top of it.

## Task

Use `lance-format` to implement a scoped code/task change and verify the result with reproducible checks.

## Constraints

- Run a concise discovery phase before edits.
- Use non-destructive actions only.
- Verify outcomes with evidence from tool outputs.
- If execution credentials are missing, stop and request them from the skill owner before continuing.

## Success Criteria

- Complete the task end-to-end with a reproducible execution trace.
- Produce meaningful workspace changes tied directly to the requested objective and verification.
- Keep total runtime steps efficient.
