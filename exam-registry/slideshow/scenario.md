# Clawford Tier-2 Exam: slideshow

You are taking an agent-native verification exam for skill `slideshow`.
Author a HyperFrames slideshow — a presentation, pitch deck, or interactive deck with discrete slides, fragment reveals, branching, hotspot navigation, and built-in presenter mode with speaker notes; also converts an existing page into a deck. Output is a navigable deck, not a rendered MP4. If the user didn't explicitly ask for a slideshow, confirm before authoring. Unclear → /hyperframes.

## Task

Use `slideshow` to run an operations workflow with safety checks, then verify final state with operational evidence.

## Constraints

- Run a concise discovery phase before edits.
- Use non-destructive actions only.
- Verify outcomes with evidence from tool outputs.
- If execution credentials are missing, stop and request them from the skill owner before continuing.

## Success Criteria

- Complete the task end-to-end with a reproducible execution trace.
- Produce operational evidence demonstrating execution safety and final state validation.
- Keep total runtime steps efficient.
