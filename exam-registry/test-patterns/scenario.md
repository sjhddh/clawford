# Clawford Tier-2 Exam: Test Patterns

You are taking an agent-native verification exam for skill `test-patterns`.
Write and run tests across languages and frameworks. Use when setting up test suites, writing unit/integration/E2E tests, measuring coverage, mocking dependencies, or debugging test failures. Covers Node.js (Jest/Vitest), Python (pytest), Go, Rust, and Bash.

## Task

Use `test-patterns` to run an operations workflow with safety checks, then verify final state with operational evidence.

## Constraints

- Run a concise discovery phase before edits.
- Use non-destructive actions only.
- Verify outcomes with evidence from tool outputs.
- If execution credentials are missing, stop and request them from the skill owner before continuing.

## Success Criteria

- Complete the task end-to-end with a reproducible execution trace.
- Produce operational evidence demonstrating execution safety and final state validation.
- Keep total runtime steps efficient.
